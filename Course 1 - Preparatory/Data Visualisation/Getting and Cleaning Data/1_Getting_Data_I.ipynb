    "In Python 3, the most popular library for web scraping is ```BeautifulSoup```. To use ```BeautifulSoup```, we will also need the ```requests``` module, which basically connects to a given URL and fetches data from it (in HTML format). A web page is basically HTML code, and the main use of ```BeautifulSoup``` is that it helps you parse HTML easily. \n",
